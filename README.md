# CRYPTOSUVI has ceased operations
We ceased block production on the Telos blockchain on [2021-08-30](https://explorer.telos.net/transaction/44f5aa496d0386d3d3a2a4052ece906f39a3ea4c93ab687270a80d55f6700619) and wound down operations.

The account `cryptosuviio` on Telos remains available on the [Telos Explorer](https://explorer.telos.net/account/cryptosuviio) and contains all relevant operations and expenses of the company.

The entity remains registered for possible future endeavours by Ville and Suvi, albeit currently inactive.
